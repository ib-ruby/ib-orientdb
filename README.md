# IB-OrientDB
Part of IB-Ruby.  Provides access to an OrientDB-Database

**[OrientDB](https://orientdb.org/)**  is a **N**ot **O**nly **SQL** Database owned and maintained by SAP.

It aims to be "the first Multi-Model Open Source NOSQL DBMS that brings together the power of graphs and the flexibility of documents into one scalable high-performance operational database."( [source](https://orientdb.org/docs/3.0.x/) )

**_IB-OrientDB_** connects a running [IB-api-client](https://github.com/ib-ruby/ib-api) to a running _OrienDB-Database-Server_ and provides 
methods to store data provided by the _Interactive Brokers TWS_ into the database. 

It replaces core functions of  **ib-gateway** from the [IB-Extensions-Gem](https://github.com/ib-ruby/ib-extensions)



**Work in Progress**
